# Trial

This is a repo in which I am trying out all the github functionalities for myself to get my hand used to the platform!

## Trial Part 2

This part of the trial is done from my local machine after cloning the trial repository to
my local machine but not before working on my ssh keys.

### Process
- create new repository in github
- create a readme file and other files and commit those changes
- clone the file using the git clone command followed by the ssh to  bring repo to local computer.

- for all other trial instructions see trial-repo2
